Hello, player!
You are playing as Console detective. You have been invited to SeaBay city to solve a mystery.
Many years ago, in 1963 young woman by name Claire Jefferson disappeared during the night.
The search was carried out for many months, but to no avail.
Claire's granddaughter decided to find out what happened and invited you and SeaBay.
You arrived to the city, walk around and take a look, the hints are waiting to be found..

In the mausoleum you find an old manuscript that tells about people with the ability to move between worlds. 
Some used mirrors, and others used natural objects: stones, lakes...

In another diary you read about how diviners have been predicting the birth dates of people with such abilities for centuries. 
Your gaze skims over the table of dates... And stumbles upon June 12, 1937, Claire's birthday!

And last of all, you read the letter. 
It says "Forgive me. I love you and don't want to leave you, but the call of fate leaves me no choice. Claire".

Apparently cosmic forces pulled Claire into another dimension. 
Although not everything is completely clear, you have received your answer and itâ€™s time to tell the client everything.
Good job! You solved the mystery and are coming back home...
